# Kattis Problems for Code Club

I may be late to the party, but it's never too late to start solving problems!

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to various Kattis problems for University of South Dakota's Code Club. I will be solving these problems primarily in Python, but I may also use other languages if I feel like it.
